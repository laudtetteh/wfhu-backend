# Strapi (NodeJS) API

## About this app
This was Version 1.0 of the Strapi backend for Work from Home University, LLC. Check out the Staging site here: https://wfhu-api.studiotenfour.biz/

Work from Home University, LLC was recently rebranded as Elisabeth Steele, LLC. Their current website at www.elisabethsteele.com is a WordPress site, which as also built by me at Studio Ten Four (www.studiotenfour.com).

For the Strapi project, I learned and used a few technologies, such as:
1. Strapi - A headless CMS, open-source, javascript framework which makes creating APIs a breeze (https://strapi.io)
2. MongoDB - A document-oriented, NoSQL database (https://www.mongodb.com)
